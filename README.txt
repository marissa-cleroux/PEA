Colour Choice
I chose the colors because I find them very easy to work with as well as pleasing to most people. I used the colour generator: https://coolors.co to find the rough outline of the colours I wanted. Afterwards, I tweaked them so that there was an appropriate contrast for accessibility.

Banner Design
The logo included in the banner is made up of my initials, making it relevant to myself. The design of the banner is minimalist. I wanted it to be simple and small - fitting in my nav-bar. I did not go for a full length banner because I wanted it to be minimalistic and having a full width banner would require some extra design to make a good banner.

CSS3 Features
- Box-shadow: box shadow was used as a separator for the nav-bar as well as for buttons when being hovered over
- var(): css variables were used values could be easily changed, thus easier to maintain. As well, variables can make code more readable.
- Media queries: I used media queries to fine-tune the design of my PEA at different breakpoints
- Grid: grid was used to facilitate the responsiveness of my banner to make room in the nav bar
- Nth-of-type: pseudo-class used to select correct p tag for adding content to the page at certain media queries
- rgba(): used to easiliy set opacity for various blacks used
