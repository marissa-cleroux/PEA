        <h2>Technical Feasibility</h2>
        <h3>Architecture Technical Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          The Nursing Skills Tracker (NST) development team decided that we
          would use ASP.NET Core along with prioritizing code first for our
          database. We chose ASP.NET Core because we wanted to get experience
          with the newer framework as well as using the new features that .NET
          Core employs: better scalability and performance than .NET Framework.
          Since we chose .NET Core, web forms were no longer an option, so we
          settled with MVC. A disadvantage of .NET Core is that it is newer and
          not battle tested in the Heritage College environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          For our in-house database we used code first as it simplifies the
          creation of the application database and makes implementing changes
          easy. A disadvantage with code first is that we get a lot of data from
          Clara, a pre-existing database. We could not use code first to
          generate the Clara models, so we had to manually implement the models
          that hold data from Clara. For the presentation layer, NST used the
          Heritage College Template as mandated by the College. We used
          Bootstrap to ease mobile responsiveness. A downfall with Bootstrap is
          it can be hard to debug. The front end used Razor pages, as it allowed
          for easy creation of dynamic pages. The
          <a
            href="./content/docs/ArchitectureDesignAndProcessReport.pdf"
            target="_blank"
            >Architecture Design Report</a
          >
          covers the architectural choices extensively.
        </p>
        <p>
          For automated testing we decided to focus on unit and integration
          testing. The automated testing frameworks we chose were xUnit (the
          syntax that allows running tests) and Moq (allows for the mocking of
          data.
        </p>
        <h3>Application Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          There are three main tiers to NST: Database, Business, and
          Presentation. Part of the database layer is housed within Heritage
          College; however, the Clara database is external and housed by the
          Ministry of Education. The business layer contains the Models, Entity
          Framework ORM, and the NstDbContext. The presentation layer consists
          of the Controllers, Razor pages, and the files within the wwwroot
          folder (CSS, JavaScript, etc.). The business layer and the
          presentation layer are both hosted on the same server within Heritage
          College. NST also makes use of the Application Management System (AMS)
          for authentication and authorization which is housed within Heritage
          College.
        </p>
        <h3>Project Trade-offs</h3>
        <p>
          During the design phase of NST, we determined what the
          <a href="./content/docs/NSTTradeOffSliders.pdf" target="_blank"
            >trade-offs</a
          >
          would be in the two major releases. For December, the biggest goal was
          to get the most features implemented as possible. In order to do this,
          we decided high quality and low defects would be a lower priority. For
          May, we placed more importance on having a system that was high
          quality and low in defects. We decided that for the second release
          less emphasis should be placed on features.

        <h2>Analysis Models</h2>
        <p>
          Initially a

            >class diagram</a
          >
          was created in October, however, as we used the agile methodology the
          model had been iterated on many times. The initial class diagram
          didn’t include the specific interfaces we required to interact with
          Clara, nor the controllers. We also didn’t realize the need we’d have
          for view models. As the code developed, we arrived at the final
          <a href="./content/images/2020ClassDiagram.png" target="_blank"
            >model.</a

        <h2>Ethical Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          One legal issue NST encountered was a teammate used an image that was
          copyrighted without the knowledge that it was copyrighted. As such,
          the project negatively impacted the creator of the image. After this
          discovery, the team became a lot more careful and made sure all images
          were created by the team or the team had rights to use the image.
