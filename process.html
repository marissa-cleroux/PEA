        <h2>Agile Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout the development of the Nursing Skills Tracker (NST) we
          followed the Agile Methodology. Agile has four core values as stated
          in the “Manifesto for Agile Software Development:”
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools,</li>
          <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation,</li>
          <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and</li>
          <li>Responding to change over following a plan.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The requirements for the Nursing Skills Tracker system were collected
          and defined as user stories based on discussions with the client. The
          user stories were in the form of: “As a
          <span class="italicize">user</span>, I want
          <span class="italicize">some functionality</span>, so that
          <span class="italicize">some purpose</span>.” For each user story we
          defined acceptance criteria, which is the “definition of done.” For
          any user story to be closed we had to fulfill all the acceptance
          criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          We completed work on user stories in iterations called sprints. Each
          sprint lasted about two weeks. All user stories for NST were
          prioritized and stored in a product backlog. In the sprint planning
          meeting the team pulled user stories from the product backlog to put
          in the sprint backlog based on the budgeted hours for the sprint. At
          the start of each day during a sprint, a daily scrum meeting was held
          where each team member answered three questions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>What have you done since the last meeting?</li>
          <li>What are you working on?</li>
          <li>Is there anything blocking you?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This allowed us to practice transparency and make sure the team was on
          the same page. Throughout each sprint we continuously integrated tests
          in a separate project so that a minimum of 60% of the code was covered
          by either unit tests or integration tests. These tests also allowed us
          to ensure that no breaking changes were committed to NST. When the
          sprint was completed, the progress made on NST was shown to the client
          in the form of a demo which gave us a chance to get feedback from the
          client. After the demo we would complete a sprint retrospective
          meeting with the project manager wherein we discussed what went well,
          what went wrong, and any remaining mysteries after the sprint/demo.
        </p>

        <h2>Agile Review for NST</h2>
        <p>
          Overall the Agile Methodology was appropriate for developing NST.
          Consistent interaction with the client allowed us to improve our
          design and feature functionality. We were able to improve as a team
          because of the transparency and open communication encouraged by the
          Agile Methodology. I do think that more emphasis on planning could
          have helped, as sometimes we didn’t plan enough, especially in terms
          of architecture, which came back to bite us later in the project.
