        <h2>Project Planning</h2>
        <p>
          After the initial meetings described in
          <a class="italicize" href="teamEnvironment.html">Team Environment</a>,
          the teams assigned story points to each project. This was done using
          “tabletop relative estimation” based on the number of external systems
          and relative complexity of the requirements laid out for each
          proposal.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the development of the Nursing Skills Tracker application
          (NST), product backlogs were used to store a prioritized list of
          unfinished user stories. In the sprint planning meeting, as a team we
          would pull out user stories from the product backlog and put them into
          the sprint’s backlog. During the sprint planning meeting, we would
          determine the budgeted hours, how many user stories we could complete
          in the sprint, and the tasks associated with each user story. The time
          to complete each task was also determined. The prioritized, tasked out
          user stories were placed in the sprint backlog. An excel version of
          the NST product backlog can be found
          <a
            href="./content/docs/MCleroux_E42_ProductBacklog.xlsx"
            target="_blank"
            >here.</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Each sprint, a sprint burndown chart would be generated. The sprint
          burndown shows the team how many hours they should have left to
          complete the sprint on time. The sprint burndown was generated based
          on the number of hours planned for the tasks and the duration of the
          sprint. The y-axis shows the number of hours. The x-axis shows the
          days. The “ideal trend” line shows how many hours should ideally be
          left on that date while the “remaining work” line shows how many hours
          are left on that date. An example of a sprint burndown chart is below.

      <section>
        <h2>Status Report</h2>
        <p>
          We used Team Foundation Server (TFS) to manage the product and sprint
          backlogs. Each task had an associated estimated time to completion,
          remaining work time, and actual completed time. The tasks were
          assigned to teammates based on priority. Each task would move from
          various states: new, active, pending review, and then closed. This,
          along with the associated time attributes always allowed for easy
          viewing of the task’s status. TFS enabled us to adapt our sizing
          technique, as we could see how much we initially estimated for a task
          and how much time the task took to complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the start of each day during a sprint, a daily scrum meeting would
          take place wherein each team member would answer three questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What did you do since last scrum?</li>
          <li>What are you going to be working on today?</li>
          <li>Is there anything blocking you or do you have any concerns?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This allowed everyone on the team to check in and give a short status
          report to everyone. Some scrum meetings seemed to be superfluous in
          cases where the previous day everyone on the team was working on the
          same thing, such as sprint planning and no tasks had been assigned for
          that day yet. In these cases, we reduced the questions to the third
          question.
