        <h2>Business Problem</h2>
        <p>
          The Nursing Program has a series of skills that students are required
          to practice in the lab setting and then in the clinical setting after
          successfully practicing it in the lab setting. Before Nursing Skills
          Tracker (NST), students had to track their skills via paper documents
          throughout the course of the program. It was very difficult for
          teachers to determine when students could practice a skill in a
          clinical setting. Students also desired a way to generate a portfolio
          of the skills they had acquired. Teachers also wanted a way for
          students to keep track of when it’s time to practice a skill again so
          that student could be autonomous. NST solved all this by allowing
          students and teachers to input evaluations for skills and easily show
          which skills students have practiced. The original elevator pitch for
          NST can be found
          <a href="./content/docs/NstElevatorPitch.pdf" target="_blank">here</a
          >.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <h3>Users & Other Systems</h3>
        <p>NST has several categories of users:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nursing Department Coordinator;</li>
          <li>Nursing Teachers;</li>
          <li>
            Nursing Clinical Teachers (teachers who supervise students in the
            clinical setting);
          </li>
          <li>
            Nursing Liaison Teachers (teachers who act as liaisons for students
            in their preceptorship); and
          </li>
          <li>Nursing Students.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>NST depends on two other systems</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Clara (an interface which stores all student, teacher, and program
            data); and
          </li>
          <li>
            The Heritage College Application Management System (AMS) (manages
            applications and authorization for Heritage College applications
            deployed by the Computer Science program).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>
          The main functionality of NST is tracking the skills gained by
          students in the Nursing program. Students can also generate portfolios
          of their acquired competencies. Teachers will use NST to leave
          evaluations for their students’ skills and give feedback. Teachers can
          also use it to track their cohorts progress and ensure individual
          students are on track. Coordinators will manage the skills and units
          available for students to evaluate as well as have the abilities of a
          teacher. Coordinators can also generate portfolios for any current or
          past students who have successfully completed skills in the clinical
          setting.
        </p>

        <p>
          All functionality is captured in the context diagram below, along with
          the systems which NST interfaces with.

        <h2>Business Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Business requirements are requirements for a system from the
          perspective of the business. A functional requirement describes
          something that the system must do. A non-functional requirement
          describes how the system must be. All functional requirements are
          captured by user stories. Acceptance criteria conveys the test
          scenarios and context for the functional requirements. An example of a
          non-functional requirement in NST is to optimize the GetAllSkills()
          method so that it is faster than 18 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the initial presentation by the client the team summarized
          the perceived requirements. We then discussed with the client if these
          requirements covered what she wanted and what her priorities were. We
          also took the opportunity to clarify any confusing specifications and
          refine the requirements. That meeting is summarized in these
          <a
            href="./content/docs/20191010_ApplicationMeetingMinutes.pdf"
            target="_blank"
            >meeting minutes</a
          >. After gathering the initial requirements, we implemented some
          functionality based on the client’s priorities and the time allocated
          to complete the sprint. During the sprint review meeting, the client
          provided feedback and had the final say on whether the requirements
          were met or if more work was needed; the notes are found
          <a
            href="./content/docs/20191119_NSTSprint1MeetingMinutes.pdf"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >
          . The same process was then carried out for the second sprint, as
          summarized
          <a
            href="./content/docs/20200204_NSTSprint2MeetingMinutes.pdf"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Example Requirement</h2>
        <p>
          An example of, one
          <a href="./content/docs/UserStoryCompleted.pdf" target="_blank"
            >user story</a
          >
          that I was the main contributor for is: “As a student, I want to be
          able to update when I have practiced a skill.” Before this
          functionality was complete, a student was not able to add a new
          evaluation to a skill once they had been evaluated. The client wanted
          the student to be able to use NST to track when they should practice a
          skill again, and thus be able to update their evaluation every time
          they practice it. The screenshot below shows a student who has
          previously evaluated a skill.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="./content/images/ScreenUserStory.png"
            alt="NST Context Diagram"

          <figcaption>
            Student has previously evaluated skill.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The student can now add a new evaluation by clicking the "+". Students
          can use NST as a tool to remind themselves when they should practice a
          skill again.
