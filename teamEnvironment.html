          In Development Project I, a series of presentations were held where
          various departments in Heritage College put forward proposals for
          potential applications. After the proposals, students came together
          and used various techniques to determine the team sizes, the team I
          was apart of used “tabletop relative estimation.” The project manager
          (PM) then averaged out the teams’ estimations to determine how many
          students should be assigned to work on each project. I was placed on a
          team with four other students:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Aaditya Chopra</li>
          <li>Marissa Cleroux (me)</li>
          <li>Maxwell Desrosiers</li>
          <li>Manuel Nieves</li>
          <li>Tristan Young</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As a team, in each sprint we would decide which tasks were priority
          and would assign tasks to each teammate. As teammates completed their
          tasks, they would grab the next task by priority
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, the team environment was supportive and cohesive, with a
          few exceptions. Highlights included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The team was able to overcome conflict and grow stronger and improve
            as a team in the process.
          </li>
          <li>
            All teammates were motivated to make the client happy, which made
            working on the project together fun, as we all had a common goal.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a team, we decided to use Slack as a communication tool. This
            made communication outside of class time seamless and ensured we
            were all on the same page.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disadvantages included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each teammate was expected to contribute 6 hours outside of class
            time, unfortunately, it could not always be reached, resulting in
            unequal amounts of work done outside of class time by each teammate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes, the team would not agree on how a task should be sized,
            this made it difficult to properly plan out a sprint.
          </li>
          <li>
            At times there was conflict that lead to a break down in team
            cohesion.
          </li>
        </ul>
