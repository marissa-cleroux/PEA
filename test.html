        <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Unit testing is an integral part of the Nursing Skills Tracker (NST)
          system. However, it is not often used as NST relies heavily on its
          database for its functionality. This prevents heavy unit testing as
          unit testing is meant to test single components, which cannot be used
          for database queries. For its unit testing framework NST uses xUnit.
          To mock dependencies NST used Moq. For methods that could be unit
          tested tests were created. Before checking in code, a developer was
          required to run the unit tests to ensure they had not broken any
          tests.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>System Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Thorough system testing was completed before NST could be considered
          for production. This was done to ensure that different components of
          NST worked together as expected and to discover as many bugs as
          possible. The main categories of system testing completed were
          functionality, usability, compatibility, business cycles, scalability,
          performance, and security.
        </p>
        <p>
          Functionality tests encompass scenarios where different parts of NST
          have functionality that interact with each other. Usability tests are
          run to ensure NST is accessible and easy to use by all users of
          different technical abilities. Compatibility tests cover NST being
          used in different browsers and on mobile to ensure NST functions as
          expected in different environments. Business cycle tests were run to
          ensure the system work as expected in different phases of the business
          cycle. Scalability tests were run to ensure that NST would function as
          expected with the maximum number of users and full load of data.
          Performance tests ensured that NST met the minimum requirements in
          performance outlined by the Computer Science department. Security
          tests were run to ensure NST was not vulnerable to common attack
          vectors.
